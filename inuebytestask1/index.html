          <p>Can’t imagine a day without makeup? We understand. While we appreciate your love for makeup, using it every day can trouble your skin in many ways. Makeup contains a lot of chemicals and components which may or may not suit your particular skin type.

            Some of these skin-unfriendly components used in everyday makeup products can even cause irritation, itchiness and sometimes even untimely ageing.</p>
            <p>Many of your daily makeup products contain harsh chemicals that can disrupt functions of the protective barrier of your skin, making it easier for pathogens to enter your skin. Using makeup regularly can cause various side effects, impacting the health and natural glow of your skin.

                However, this doesn’t mean that you cannot use makeup at all. If you follow a few healthy makeup habits and choose skin-friendly products, you can continue to wear makeup everyday.
